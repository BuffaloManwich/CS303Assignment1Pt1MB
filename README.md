# CS303Assignment1Pt1MB
This is an assignment to build array functions that replicate the functionality of vectors.
The main program will read the inputs from the file "A1input.txt" into integer arrays.
This will require a user screen to choose the operation from a list. It will require a read array option, and manipulate array menu. The manipulate menu will have "add int", "del int", "search for int", "change index val",
